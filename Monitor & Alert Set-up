Step 1: Log in to AWS Management Console
    Go to the AWS Management Console.

    Sign in with your credentials.

Step 2: Enable CloudWatch Monitoring
  Navigate to CloudWatch:

    In the AWS Management Console, search for CloudWatch in the search bar and select it.

    Ensure your resources (e.g., EC2 instances, Lambda functions, RDS databases) are sending metrics to CloudWatch:

    For EC2 instances, enable Detailed Monitoring in the EC2 dashboard if needed.

    For Lambda functions, metrics are automatically sent to CloudWatch.

    For RDS databases, ensure monitoring is enabled in the RDS dashboard.

Step 3: Create a CloudWatch Dashboard
    In the CloudWatch console, go to Dashboards in the left-hand menu.

    Click Create Dashboard.

    Give your dashboard a name (e.g., MyApp-Monitoring-Dashboard).

    Add widgets to visualize metrics:

    Click Add Widget.

    Choose a widget type (e.g., Line, Stacked Area, Number).

    Select the metrics you want to monitor:

    EC2: CPUUtilization, NetworkIn, NetworkOut, DiskReadOps, DiskWriteOps.

    Lambda: Invocations, Errors, Duration, Throttles.

    RDS: CPUUtilization, DatabaseConnections, FreeStorageSpace.

    Customize the time range (e.g., last 1 hour, last 24 hours).

    Repeat the process to add more widgets for other metrics.

    Arrange the widgets on the dashboard for better visibility.

Step 4: Set Up CloudWatch Alarms
  In the CloudWatch console, go to Alarms in the left-hand menu.

    Click Create Alarm.

    Choose a metric:

    Click Select Metric.

    Choose the namespace (e.g., EC2, Lambda, RDS).

    Select the metric (e.g., CPUUtilization for EC2, Errors for Lambda).

    Set the alarm conditions:

    Define the threshold (e.g., CPU > 80% for 5 minutes).

    Choose the statistic (e.g., Average, Maximum).

    Set the period (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes).

    Configure actions:

    Click Add Notification.

    Choose an existing SNS Topic or create a new one.

    Enter your email address to receive notifications.

    Confirm the subscription by clicking the link in the confirmation email.

Step 5: Test Your Setup
    Simulate high CPU usage or errors on your application.

    Verify that the metrics appear on your CloudWatch dashboard.

    Check if the alarm triggers and you receive a notification via email.
